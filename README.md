# techdegree-project-7 -- WebApp Dashboard

In this project, I took a mockup and a few icons and built a responsive web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. I created the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for this one page -- I did not need to create other pages, or build any backend or database functionality.

The project involved creating tables, charts, graphics and other user interface components in a manner that promotes interactivity and usability.

Clicking notifications bell pops-up modals that display recent activity.

Selecting the different chart time periods updats charts dynamically.

Searching for users displays drop down list of users who match input letters.

Messaging user displays an alert that message was sent successfully.

Settings can be saved to the browser's localStorage and retained after page refresh or close. Clearing will clear localStorage and reset all toggles and the time zone list.
